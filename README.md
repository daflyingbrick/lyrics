## America
### Simon & Garfunkel
*Capo 2/C Shape*<br /> 
[humming] intro:<br /> 
C Cmaj7 Am G F <br />
**V1** <br />
C Cmaj7 Am G F<br />  
Let us be lovers, we’ll marry our fortunes together  <br />
C Cmaj7 Am <br />
I've got some real estate here in my bag <br />
Em7 A7 Em7 A7 <br />
So we bought a pack of cigarettes, and Mrs. Wagner's pies <br />
D C G Am ... F (full bar)<br /> 
And walked off, to look for America<br /> 
**V2** <br />
C Cmaj7 Am G F<br />  
"Kathy", I said, as we boarded a Greyhound in Pittsburgh <br />
C Cmaj7 Am F  <br />
Michigan seems like a dream to me now <br />
G<br /> 
It took me four days to hitch-hike from Saginaw <br /> 
D G D Cmaj7<br /> 
"I've come to look for America" <br />
**Bridge** <br />
Bbmaj7 (4 bars) C<br /> 
Laughing on the bus, playing games with the faces...  <br />
C (4 bars)  <br />
She said the man in the gabardine suit was a spy  <br />
FC  <br />
I said, "Be careful, his bow tie is really a camera...”  <br />
  
Cmaj7/Am/D9... F7<br />  
(leaving space here — jam?)<br />  
C Cmaj7 Am G F  <br />
"Toss me a cigarette; I think there's one in my raincoat"<br />  
C Cmaj7AmF <br />
We smoked the last one an hour ago<br /> 
Em7 A7 Em7 A7  <br />
So I looked at the scenery. She read her magazine<br /> 
D C G Am-G C ... F <br />
And the moon rose over an open-field <br />
C Cmaj7 Am F  <br />
"Kathy, I'm lost,” I said, though I knew she was sleeping<br /> 
C Cmaj7 Am <br />
"I'm empty and aching and I don't know why!” <br />
G (4 bars) <br />
Counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpik<br />e
D G D Cmaj7 <br />
They've all come, To look for America<br />
D G D Cmaj7 <br />
ALL come to look for America
D G D Cmaj7 <br />
ALL come to look for — America ...<br />
[2x but maybe longer?]
