## America
### Simon & Garfunkel
*Capo 2/C Shape* 
[humming] intro: 
C Cmaj7 Am G F 
**V1** 
C Cmaj7 Am G F  
Let us be lovers, we’ll marry our fortunes together  
C Cmaj7 Am 
I've got some real estate here in my bag 
Em7 A7 Em7 A7 
So we bought a pack of cigarettes, and Mrs. Wagner's pies 
D C G Am ... F (full bar) 
And walked off, to look for America 
**V2** 
C Cmaj7 Am G F  
"Kathy", I said, as we boarded a Greyhound in Pittsburgh 
C Cmaj7 Am F  
Michigan seems like a dream to me now 
G 
It took me four days to hitch-hike from Saginaw  
D G D Cmaj7 
"I've come to look for America" 
**Bridge** 
Bbmaj7 (4 bars) C 
Laughing on the bus, playing games with the faces...  
C (4 bars)  
She said the man in the gabardine suit was a spy  
FC  
I said, "Be careful, his bow tie is really a camera...”  
  
Cmaj7/Am/D9... F7  
(leaving space here — jam?)  
C Cmaj7 Am G F  
"Toss me a cigarette; I think there's one in my raincoat"  
C Cmaj7AmF 
We smoked the last one an hour ago 
Em7 A7 Em7 A7  
So I looked at the scenery. She read her magazine 
D C G Am-G C ... F 
And the moon rose over an open-field 
C Cmaj7 Am F  
"Kathy, I'm lost,” I said, though I knew she was sleeping 
C Cmaj7 Am 
"I'm empty and aching and I don't know why!” 
G (4 bars) 
Counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike
D G D Cmaj7 
They've all come, To look for America
D G D Cmaj7 
ALL come to look for America
D G D Cmaj7 
ALL come to look for — America ...
[2x but maybe longer?]
